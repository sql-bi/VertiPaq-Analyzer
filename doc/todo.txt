add report measures to consumer
this will require to add a collection of TcdxExpressions with a enum type that will contain MXD or DAX (possibly extended in the future)
Each expression will be tied to a Table/measure_name

We should consider using the measure class from the vpax library since there are many more details we might need to complete the analysis.

This might require to create a dependency from Vpax library, this might help by using DaxName instead of TcdxName
